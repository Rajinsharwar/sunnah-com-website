One of the most practical, uplifting, and motivational branches of Ulūm al-Qur’an (Sciences of the Qur’an) is the <i>faḍā’il</i> (virtues) of specific suwar and āyāt. For example, many Muslims may know about the verses that should be recited for ruqyah (healing), or the sūrah that will serve as a protection in the grave, or the suwar that offer shade on the Day of Resurrection. The benefits of studying this topic are multi-faceted, but generally can be summarized as follows:
<ol>
<li>A greater connection to specific suwar and āyāt of the Qur’an, thereby increasing one’s connection to Allah ﷻ. </li>
<li>The reward, blessings, or protection found through a relationship with these suwar and āyāt, such as protection in this life (e.g., Āyat al-Kursī), in the grave (e.g., Sūrat al-Mulk), or on the Day of Judgment (e.g., Sūrat al-Baqarah). </li>
<li>Motivation to recite the Quran more consistently and to stay connected to it as a lifestyle, and to take it as a companion in this life while looking forward to its companionship in the next life.</li>
<li>An increased reliance upon Allah (i.e., tawakkul) by taking measures, as well as the peace, tranquility, and happiness that comes with it.</li>
<li>Gratitude to Allah for granting us specific avenues of protection, rewards, or blessings in certain suwar or āyāt.</li>
<li>An increased knowledge and reminder of important theological concepts, motivation, and laws found in these suwar and āyāt. </li>
<li>An ease in memorizing more suwar and āyāt of the Qur’an because of the frequency in reciting them and hearing them from others. </li>
</ol>

This compilation covers as many of the authenticated narrations about different suwar and āyāt as possible, while emphasizing that it is not exhaustive. A virtue, in this case, refers to a special trait of the sūrah or āyah that was mentioned in an authentic report, such as a special reward for the one who recites a particular sūrah, or a protection for reciting a specific āyah, or something that was recited at a particular frequency by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or was beloved to him.
